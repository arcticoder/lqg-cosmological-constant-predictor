Short description (suggested):
Research-stage, model-dependent LQG approach for scale-dependent cosmological constant predictions with integrated uncertainty quantification. Not production-certified; results require independent validation.

Long description (suggested):
This repository explores a research-stage, first-principles Loop Quantum Gravity formulation for estimating a scale-dependent cosmological constant (vacuum energy density). Methods include polymer quantization adjustments, SU(2) 3nj corrections, and Bayesian UQ. Numerical outputs are model- and configuration-dependent; performance and consistency metrics reflect internal benchmarks. Do not use for engineering decisions without independent validation and peer review.

Maintenance note:
Please keep claims conservative and link to raw artifacts or scripts when asserting performance or physical feasibility.
